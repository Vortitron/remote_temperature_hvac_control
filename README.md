Tricks a HVAC in Home assistant to heat according to a remote thermometer 

Just hardcoded in the yaml right now.. I might do a thing for it later

It sets the desired temperature of the HVAC to 2C away from what it thinks it is... with various limits and mode changes.

It assumes living in a cold country where it's on heat mode most days but should turn to fan only if it gets warm
